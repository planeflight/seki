          The Lakes Trail is one of the most popular wilderness hikes in Sequoia
          National Park. You will climb from the Wolverton trailhead to three
          gorgeous alpine lakes: Heather, Emerald, and Pear. Aster lake is not
          far off the trail and can be viewed from the trail as well! This route
          can be done as a day trip on horseback or on foot. Hikers can make
          this into an overnight backpacking trip, but horseback riding and pack
          use is limited to day use only. This route follows the Lake Trail for
          most of the way, with a short stint on a segment known as the "Hump
          Trail".

        <p>
          Sequoia National Parkâ€™s Alta Peak is a showcase of grand panoramic
          vistas, especially during the last push to the summit. The alpine
          scenery around the peak is also strikingly beautiful. During the
          summer months, alpine wildflowers bloom along the trail. You'll also
          get a chance to see the rare Foxtail Pine (a relative of the famous
          Bristlecone Pine).
